[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:/external-services/index.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:/external-services/index.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.

=== Statica Environment Variables
We recommend setting the following environment variables within your application runtime to connect the service to your app:

|===
|Variable Name|Example Value
|STATICA_STATICA_URL|http://statica124:d3daz61r04bd37db@us-east-1-static-brooks.quotaguard.com:9293
|===

Use the link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools] to set environment variables to make your credentials available within your application runtime:

[source,console]
----
$ rhc env set STATICA_STATICA_URL=VALUE -a App_Name
----

NOTE: Check out the general link:/external-services/index.html#code-examples[code examples] to see how to use environment variables within your application.
