MemCachier manages and scales clusters of memcache servers so you can focus on your app. Our custom memcache implementation offers better reliability and usability than memcached, with the same low latency. Tell us how much memory you need and get started for free instantly. Add capacity later as you need it without changing any code.

== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:/external-services/index.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:/external-services/index.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.
