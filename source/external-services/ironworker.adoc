[.lead]
IronWorker is an elastic task queue / worker service that scales to handle whatever workloads you send it. Every production-scale application needs to do work in the background. IronWorker gives you a reliable way to run tens, hundreds, or thousands of tasks at once. Queue tasks from your app, schedule jobs to run later, or fire off tasks from webhooks. No need to stand up servers or manage queues. IronWorker scales out the processing to let you focus on building apps at scale.

[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:/external-services/index.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:/external-services/index.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.

=== IronWorker Environment Variables
We recommend setting the following environment variables within your application runtime to connect the service to your app:

|===
|Variable Name|Example Value
|IRONWORKER_PROJECT_ID|54eb11d25ab8530006000002
|IRONWORKER_TOKEN|ark7YJLW3ysx919eweEIdLbWysE
|===

Use the link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools] to set environment variables to make your credentials available within your application runtime:

[source,console]
----
$ rhc env set IRONWORKER_PROJECT_ID=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set IRONWORKER_TOKEN=VALUE -a App_Name
