The CloudAMQP dashboard allows you to show the current message rate, which queues and exchanges you have, and the bindings between them. You can also queue and pop messages manually, among other things.

[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:/external-services/index.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:/external-services/index.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.

=== CloudAMQP Environment Variables
We recommend setting the following environment variables within your application runtime to connect the service to your app:

|===
|Variable Name|Example Value
|CLOUDAMQP_HTTP_API_URI|https://raeixzae:0bkCpX1Ex2p0Qr2otrLhOyzdLKpXw8Kj@tiger.cloudamqp.com/api/
|CLOUDAMQP_URI|amqp://raeixzae:0bkCpX1Ex2p0Qr2otrLhOyzdLKpXw8Kj@tiger.cloudamqp.com/raeixzae
|===

Use the link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools] to set environment variables to make your credentials available within your application runtime:

[source,console]
----
$ rhc env set CLOUDAMQP_HTTP_API_URI=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set CLOUDAMQP_URI=VALUE -a App_Name
