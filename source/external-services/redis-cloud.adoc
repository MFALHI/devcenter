[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:/external-services/index.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:/external-services/index.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.

=== Redis Cloud Environment Variables
We recommend setting the following environment variables within your application runtime to connect the service to your app:

|===
|Variable Name|Example Value
|REDISCLOUD_HOSTNAME|pub-redis-19575.us-east-1-1.2.ec2.garantiadata.com
|REDISCLOUD_PASSWORD|5EeMbEAhQ612RQSA
|REDISCLOUD_PORT|19575
|===

Use the link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools] to set environment variables to make your credentials available within your application runtime:

[source,console]
----
$ rhc env set REDISCLOUD_HOSTNAME=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set REDISCLOUD_PASSWORD=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set REDISCLOUD_PORT=VALUE -a App_Name
