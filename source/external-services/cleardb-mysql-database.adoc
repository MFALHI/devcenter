[[dashboard]]
== Dashboard

The ClearDB dashboard allows you to manage your database, monitor performance, access backups, and view your credentials. You can also manage your support cases, among other things.

[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:/external-services/index.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:/external-services/index.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.

=== ClearDB Environment Variables
We recommend setting the following environment variables within your application runtime to connect the service to your app:

|===
|Variable Name|Example Value
|CLEARDB_JDBCURL|jdbc:mysql://a6bc2e19e4di54:a107a37e@us-cdbr-iron-east-01.cleardb.net:3306/ad_e2530aa1edi1ae6
|CLEARDB_NAME|ad_e2530aa1edi1ae6
|CLEARDB_PASSWORD|a107a37e
|CLEARDB_PORT|3306
|CLEARDB_URI|mysql://a6bc2e19e4di54:a107a37e@us-cdbr-iron-east-01.cleardb.net:3306/ad_e2530aa1edi1ae6?reconnect=true
|CLEARDB_USERNAME|a6bc2e19e4di54
|===

Use the link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools] to set environment variables to make your credentials available within your application runtime:

[source,console]
----
$ rhc env set CLEARDB_JDBCURL=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set CLEARDB_NAME=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set CLEARDB_PASSWORD=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set CLEARDB_PORT=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set CLEARDB_URI=VALUE -a App_Name
$ rhc env set CLEARDB_USERNAME=VALUE -a App_Name
----

NOTE: Check out the general link:/external-services/index.html#code-examples[code examples] to see how to use environment variables within your application.

[[code-examples]]
== Code Examples
The following code example shows how to easily configure your application to connect to a MySQL database provided by ClearDB.

=== PHP
Connecting to ClearDB from PHP merely requires the parsing of the `cleardb_*` environment variable and passing the extracted connection information to your MySQL library of choice, e.g. MySQLi:

[source, php]
----
<?php
$CLEARDB_URL = parse_url(getenv("CLEARDB_URI"));

$conn = new mysqli(
 $CLEARDB_URL['host'],
 getenv('CLEARDB_USERNAME'),
 getenv('CLEARDB_PASSWORD'),
 getenv('CLEARDB_NAME'),
 getenv('CLEARDB_PORT')
);
?>
----

You can then issue queries against the database using `$conn->query()`.
