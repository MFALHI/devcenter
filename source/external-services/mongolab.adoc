[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:/external-services/index.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:/external-services/index.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.

=== MongoLab Environment Variables
We recommend setting the following environment variables within your application runtime to connect the service to your app:

|===

|MONGOLAB_URI|mongodb://openshift_i9ae1kej_r5sqcp89_jutnauic:fPQDqehF7iM1HeQpih_xNk8sNKqsZEtK@ds051110.mongolab.com:51740/openshift_i9ae1kej_r5sqcp89
|===

Use the link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools] to set environment variables to make your credentials available within your application runtime:
