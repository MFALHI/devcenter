== Using PuTTY on Windows
PuTTY is a popular free SSH client for Windows. This document shows how to install and configure PuTTY so that you can connect to your application with SSH on a Windows machine.

NOTE: Using PuTTY is optional. If you've installed Ruby and Git for Windows as outlined link:/getting-started/windows.html#client-tools[here], you can use the `rhc ssh` command to access the OpenShift shell. See link:/managing-your-applications/remote-connection.html#connecting-to-your-application[Connecting to Your Application] for more details on the `rhc ssh` command.

[[importing-your-ssh-key]]
=== Importing your SSH Key
This section assumes that `rhc setup` was already run or that you have completed alternate steps to create an SSH key pair for use with OpenShift. We want to import that key for use with PuTTY.

If you have not run `rhc setup`, visit the link:/getting-started/index.html[Getting Started] page and complete the Command Line setup steps before continuing.

==== Step 1: Launch PuTTYgen
Launch PuTTYgen, the PuTTY key manager. From the Start Menu type *putty* in the search box. A list of putty applications shows up. Click on *PuTTYgen*. On older versions of Windows navigate to the PuTTY folder and launch it from there.

image::overview-ssh-putty-launch-1.png[]

==== Step 2: Import the SSH Key
Once PuTTYgen starts go to the *Conversions* menu and select the *Import key* item.

image::overview-ssh-putty-launch-2.png[]

Alternatively, you can use the *Generate* button to create a new pair of keys. Just make sure to register any new public keys in link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/settings[your openshift account setting page].

==== Step 3: Select the SSH Key for Import
A file dialog should pop up. Navigate to the `.ssh` directory in your user folder `C:<user name>\.ssh` and select the *id_rsa* key that was generated for you by `rhc setup`.

image::overview-ssh-putty-launch-3.png[]

==== Step 4: Save the Private Key as a .PPK File
PuTTYgen loads your key and displays it. Click the *Save private key* button in this dialog.

image::overview-ssh-putty-launch-4.png[]

==== Step 5: Select a Key Name
Another file dialog pops up prompting you for a location to save the key. Again navigate to the `.ssh` directory in your user folder `C:&lt;user name>\.ssh`. Name the key something you will remember and make sure you do not overwrite any files in this directory. Good names to use are `default.ppk` or `id_rsa.ppk`.

You've imported your SSH key and may close the PuTTYgen application.

[[configuring-a-session-to-connect-to-your-application]]
=== Configuring a Session to Connect to Your Application
This section assumes you've already created an application on OpenShift and now want to configure PuTTY to easily connect to it with SSH.

==== Step 1: Launch PuTTY
If you selected the option to put an icon on the desktop or a button the start menu, launch PuTTY from there. Otherwise, click on the Start menu and in the search box type in *putty*. Select the PuTTY application to
run. On older versions of windows you may need to navigate to the *PuTTY* directory in the Start Menu and launch it from there.

image::overview-ssh-putty-configure-1.png[]

==== Step 2: Get the SSH Address
Now we need to get the SSH address of your application to enter into PuTTY. The easiest way to find the SSH address is find it in the link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/applications[applications list page of the web console] and click on your application to reach the details page. Once on the details page, look under the *Remote Access* section on the right. This section includes the ssh command and the address. In the next step copy this text, _removing_ the *ssh* command from the front of the string.

image::overview-ssh-putty-configure-2.png[]

==== Step 3: Enter the Address into PuTTY
In the *Session* category, under the *Host Name* form, paste the text you copied from the previous step, remembering to remove the `ssh` command from the begining of the string.

image::overview-ssh-putty-configure-3.png[]

==== Step 4: Associate Your SSH Key with the Session
In the *Category* tree, expand the *Connection* and then *SSH* categories and select *Auth*. Click on the *Browse* button and navigate to the `.ssh` directory in your user folder `C:&lt;user name>\.ssh` and select the `.ppk` file you saved there.

image::overview-ssh-putty-configure-4.png[]

==== Step 5: Save Your Session
In the *Category* tree go back to the *Session* category. In the *Saved Sessions* form name your session. We recommend using the name of your application. Click the *Save* button and watch it pop up in the list.

Click the *Open* button to connect to your application.

Whenever you wish to connect to your application, simply select your session in the list. Click on the *Load* button and then click on the *Open* button.
