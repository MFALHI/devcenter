== OpenShift QuickStart Developer's Guide
In this guide, we will outline the process for creating a new QuickStart as well as keeping it up-to-date and secure.
link:https://github.com/search?q=username%3Aopenshift+%22-example%22+OR+%22-quickstart%22&type=Repositories[This
GitHub search] will lead you to the official OpenShift QuickStarts,
which you can then filter by language. This are a good place to look
for ideas if you are writing your first QuickStart (or having problems
getting it working just right).

Read on for more info an authoring QuickStarts for the OpenShift
system...

=== QuickStart Creation
Building a QuickStart consists of the following tasks:

* Create a base application using the OpenShift website or command-line
tools.
* Replace the default OpenShift example pages with your QuickStart code.
* Modify the QuickStart code to leverage OpenShift environment variables
and security libraries.
* Test the QuickStart on your own and with the community.
* Submit it for adoption as an official QuickStart.

[[create-a-base-application]]
==== 1. Create a Base Application

First, create a base application using one of the supported OpenShift
application types:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create APP_NAME APP_TYPE
--

Next, embed any cartridges (like a database) that your QuickStart will
require:

[source]
--
$ rhc cartridge add CARTRIDGE_TYPE -a APP_NAME
--

Remove the OpenShift example pages (like index.php); these files will be
replaced by your application.

[[replace-openshift-example-pages-with-quickstart-code]]
==== 2. Replace OpenShift Example Pages with QuickStart Code


Follow these steps carefully to ensure the integrity and security of
your QuickStart. At the end of this step, you should have a working
application.

IMPORTANT: If this process is not followed, the QuickStart will not be
approved

[[installing-quickstart-code-from-an-installer-script]]
===== Installing QuickStart Code from an Installer Script

If your project needs to be installed (like a Rails application),
install your application and jump to the section titled
link:#capture-the-addition-of-the-quickstart-code-as-a-single-commit[Capture the Addition of the
QuickStart Code as a Single Commit].

[[installing-from-an-archive-based-code-distro]]
===== Installing from an Archive-Based Code Distro

If your QuickStart code is distributed as a an archive (like a tarball),
you will need unpack the files before you add them to your git
repository. Do not include the original archive as part of the
QuickStart, but before you delete it, note the archive's original name
and hash keyfootnote:[Either SHA or MD5 are fine.].

Depending on your base application type, you may need to rename your
directories to match expected app settings. Quick-starts built on our
PHP base application, for instance, must be rooted in the `php` folder
of the local git repo. If your app has a differently named root folder,
here is a safe way to lay out your new files over any files that were
part of the base app. Note that we are working with a PHP-based
QuickStart in this example:

Untar your code into a temporary directory and rename the root folder of
the code to match the OpenShift application type that you are working
with:

[source]
--
$ tar xzf <tarball>.tar.gz
$ mv <tardirectory> php
--

Create a new tar file with the renamed directory:

[source]
--
$ tar czf temporary.tgz php
--

In your local git repo, untar the file over the one that already exists:

[source]
--
$ cd <git_repo_dir>
$ tar xzf temporary.tgz
--

[[capture-the-addition-of-the-quickstart-code-as-a-single-commit]]
==== 3. Capture the Addition of the QuickStart Code as a Single Commit

Now you can do a `git add .` to pull in all of the new and changed files
introduced by the QuickStart code.

Regardless of what method you used to add your QuickStart app code to
the base application, you should now check in this initial update as a
single commit. Do not remove any files during this step; the only
exceptions are unused or temporary files that take up a significant
amount of space (over 10M). If you do have to remove such files, make
sure to thoroughly document what files are removed in the commit
message.

In your commit message, be sure to include the exact version of the
QuickStart code that you've added, and the information that you recorded
about the QuickStart source tarball (name and hash sum) if appropriate.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind, the more specific and clear commit messages are,
the easier it will be for OpenShift developers to validate the process
(and find potential issues)._

[[clean-up-the-installation]]
==== 4. Clean up the installation

The installation process may have left some files in your application
that are no longer needed. This process isn't necessary, but may help
save space if there are a lot of files. For instance:

[[sampleexample-files]]
===== Sample/example files

The configuration process will mostly be handled by you, the QuickStart
author, so these files may not be needed by the user (and they can
always look at the git repository or find them online).

[[log-files]]
===== Log files

Some installers might include log files, these should be removed. In
addition to taking up unnecessary space, these log files might have
information about your personal machine or OpenShift instance.

[[configure-your-quickstart-for-openshift]]
==== 5. Configure Your QuickStart for OpenShift

Configure `.openshift/action_hooks` to enable your application to run on
OpenShift. This may include either initializing or updating a database
when your application is deployed. Have a look at our
link:https://github.com/openshift/wordpress-example/tree/master/.openshift/action_hooks[WordPress
QuickStart] for examples of how this is done.

Configure your application to use OpenShift environment variables. This
may include setting your database information or local/temporary file
paths. For instance, this
link:https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-example/blob/master/php/app/Config/database.php#L86[CakePHP
QuickStart] overrides its default database settings by reading in
OpenShift variables at run time. More information about the available
environment variables can be found link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[here].

[[secure-your-quickstart]]
==== 6. Secure Your QuickStart

Open-source projects often ship with publicly visible default security
settings. These include secret keys, salts, and easy-to-find default
passwords. In order to develop QuickStarts that may eventually become
fully developed OpenShift application templates, you must review your
QuickStart code and modify it as necessary to replace these static
security values with values that are established on a per-instance basis
and are therefore much harder to guess at.

Here are three examples of security libraries that you can copy into your QuickStarts:

* link:https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-example/blob/master/libs/openshift.inc[A
PHP-based version]
* link:https://github.com/openshift/django-example/blob/master/wsgi/openshift/openshiftlibs.py[A
Python-based version]
* link:https://github.com/fotioslindiakos/crankcase/blob/secure_functions/cartridges/ruby-1.8/template/libs/openshift_secret_generator.rb[A
Ruby-based version]

See link:#security-best-practices[Security Best Practices] below for a
more complete discussion of how to secure your QuickStart.

[[test-test-test-...]]
==== 7. Test, Test, Test, ...

Deploy your application from scratch using your own directions (or have
a friend try it) If your application has automated tests, use them! You
can also try to run tests by SSHing directly into your application and
executing them Use your application Most problems can be found by simply
using your application and trying to touch as many different areas as
you can Can you perform operations that need to write to a database or
files? Can you run an update or install themes/extensions/etc? Can you
restart the application from its interface Does it work properly if you
restart it through OpenShift?

[[publicize-your-quickstart]]
==== 8. Publicize Your QuickStart

When you think your QuickStart is complete, publicize it!

* Post to the OpenShift forums
* Mention it on IRC
* Tweet it

Try to involve the community for your application. They may have
suggestions or be able to help with testing; other QuickStart developers
may have suggestions as well.

[[submit-your-quickstart-for-publication]]
==== 9. Submit Your QuickStart for Publication!

link:https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/new[Go here] and follow the directions for
submitting a new QuickStart.

[[security-best-practices]]
=== Security Best Practices

Here are some steps QuickStart authors and OpenShift developers should
follow to ensure that user applications created from this QuickStart are
as secure as possible.

[[for-quickstart-authors]]
==== For QuickStart Authors

Quick-start authors should review their git repos for hard-coded
security values and other vulnerabilities.

[[replacing-defaults-with-secure-variables]]
==== Replacing Defaults with Secure Variables

Many installation processes will randomly generate static strings for
"security" variables, like seed values for your cookies or salts for
your password hashes. Unfortunately, these static versions will be
checked into your repository, and anybody who deploys an application
from your QuickStart will have this same value. Consequently, it is
important to modify your code so that after your QuickStart is deployed,
any statically defined security variables are regenerated.

This concept is probably best understood through example and can be seen
in our
link:https://github.com/openshift/wordpress-example/blob/master/php/wp-config.php[WordPress
QuickStart]:

First, a hash of default keys is created based on the hard-coded values
from the application:

[source, php]
--
// Set the default keys to use
$_default_keys = array(
  'AUTH_KEY'          => ' w*lE&r=t-;!|rhdx5}vlF+b=+D>a)R:nTY1Kdrw[~1,xDQS]L&PA%uyZ2:w6#ec',
  'SECURE_AUTH_KEY'   => '}Sd%ePgS5R[KwDxdBt56(DM:0m1^4)-k6_p8}|C:[-ei:&qA)j!X`:7d-krLZM*5',
  'LOGGED_IN_KEY'     => '$l^J?o)!zhp6s[-x^ckF}|BjU4d+(g1as)n/Q^s+k|,ZZc@E^h%Rx@VTm|0|?]6R',
  'NONCE_KEY'         => '#f^JM8d^!sVsq]~|4flCZHdaTy.-I.f+1tc[!h?%-+]U}|_8qc K=k;]mXePl-4v',
  'AUTH_SALT'         => 'I_wL2t!|mSw_z_ zyIY:q6{IHw:R1yTPAO^%!5,*bF5^VX`5aO4]D=mtu~6]d}K?',
  'SECURE_AUTH_SALT'  => '&%j?6!d<3IR%L[@iz=^OH!oHRXs4W|D,VCD7w%TC.uUa`NpOH_XXpGtL$A]{+pv9',
  'LOGGED_IN_SALT'    => 'N<mft[~OZp0&Sn#t(IK2px0{KloRcjvIJ1+]:,Ye]>tb*_aM8P&2-bU~_Z>L/n(k',
  'NONCE_SALT'        => 'u E-DQw%[k7l8SX=fsAVT@|_U/~_CUZesq{v(=y2}#X&lTRL{uOVzw6b!]`frTQ|'
);
--

Next, this function is defined to generate a new random key base on the
length of the original:

[source, php]
--
// This function gets called by openshift_secure and passes an array
function make_secure_key($args) {
  $hash = $args['hash'];
  $key  = $args['variable'];
  $original = $args['original'];

  $chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789';
  $chars .= '!@#$%^&*()';
  $chars .= '-_ []{}<>~`+=,.;:/?|';

  // Convert the hash to an int to seed the RNG
  srand(hexdec(substr($hash,0,8)));
  // Create a random string the same length as the default
  $val = '';
  for($i = 1; $i <= strlen($original); $i++){
    $val .= substr( $chars, rand(0,strlen($chars))-1, 1);
  }
  // Reset the RNG
  srand();
  // Set the value
  return $val;
}
--

Finally, a new array is created by applying the function to the default
values to generate new keys:

[source, php]
--
// Generate OpenShift secure keys (or return defaults if not on OpenShift)
$array = openshift_secure($_default_keys,'make_secure_key');
--

Notice that this last line actually invokes a function called
`openshift_secure()`. The OpenShift team provides security functions for
various languages. The location of these scripts varies between
cartridge types, but can generally be found in
`$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/libs`footnote:[These are not included in any
cartridges by default.]. You should include it directly from this
directory if possible, or move it if you need to. You may need to
explicitly include the security library's filepath in order to call it
within the QuickStart code.

IMPORTANT: As a performance consideration, try to include this somewhere
that will only be executed at deploy time or can be cached.

[[why-use-the-openshift-security-libraries]]
==== Why use the OpenShift Security Libraries?

These libraries leverage a secret token that exists only in your
deployed OpenShift application. This variable doesn't exist anywhere in
your repository, so there is no risk of accidentally exposing it to the
public. When implemented correctly (see the code example above), the
values will always be correct across deployments of your application
(even scaled apps).

Additionally, the application will continue to work on non-OpenShift
installations; but note that the generated values will be different in
these environments. This should be acceptable for development purposes
provided you are not mixing OpenShift-based deployments with
non-OpenShift-base deployments.

[[capturing-security-changes-to-simplify-maintenance]]
==== Capturing Security Changes to Simplify Maintenance

Ideally, your security changes should be included in such a way that an
update to the underlying OpenShift code should not necessitate changes
to the configuration file. However, these changes could still be lost if
you upgrade your QuickStart from a newer version of the application's
source code.

To protect against this, record your changes for future reuse with a
patch file and a README document that will live in the `.openshift`
directory of your QuickStart:

1.  Once you've successfully applied your security changes, use a
`git rebase -i <base commit>` to squash those security changes into a
single commit.
2.  Then use
`git format-patch <prior commit>..<security commit> --stdout > ~/template.patch`
to capture your changes in a patch file.
3.  Visually review the patch file to ensure that it _only_ contains
changes related to applying security code to the QuickStart source code.
Revise as necessary.
4.  Add the patch file to the `.openshift` directory along with a README
explaining how to apply it (see the
https://github.com/nhr/django-example/tree/master/.openshift[Django
example] for reference).

[[general-warnings-about-changes-to-security-codes]]
==== General Warnings About Changes to Security Codes

Make sure you understand and document the repercussions of modifying
these variables. For some applications, this may have varying levels of
impact, such as:

* Invalidating current user sessions
* Invalidating outstanding single-use URLs (like password reset emails)
* Rendering hashed passwords unusable (if a password is stored salted,
and the salt is changed, it may be impossible to validate a user's login
attempt)

Sometimes these changes may not be planned -

* A user may have a need to reset their token at some point (like if
they feel it is compromised)
* There is a possibility that the process the OpenShift functions
utilize will change

[[patching-from-quickstart-source-updates]]
==== Patching from QuickStart Source Updates

Monitor your project for vulnerability disclosures. There are lists such
as http://cve.mitre.org/[CVE] that you can watch for vulnerabilities for
specific versions of software. When there are vulnerabilities, take care
to do the following:

1.  Update a file in your QuickStart (such as your README) to identify
the vulnerabilty
2.  If there _is_ a solution to the vulnerability, apply the fix and
document the changes (and what bug/vulnerability it was for) in a single
commit. This may also require you to re-apply or update your security
patch file (see link:#CapturingSecurityChanges[Capturing Security
Changes to Simplify Maintenance]).
3.  If there is no solution, document any sort of workarounds or links
to ongoing research in your README. Monitor the progress and impement a
solution as soon as one becomes available.

Submit these as a pull-request against the official OpenShift repository
for the QuickStart. Monitor the progress of the pull-request, other
people may suggest additional solutions.

[[security-best-practices-from-the-source-application-authors]]
==== Security Best Practices from the Source Application Authors

Try to implement any security "best practices" for your application.
Some of these may be very simple to implement in the master
configuration files and will benefit many users. Otherwse, if there is
something an invidual user can do after their application is configured,
make sure to make a note of it in your README

[[for-openshift-developers]]
=== For OpenShift Developers

If you have been asked to review a QuickStart for inclusion in our
QuickStart library, please do the following security audit. Note that
you do not have to be an expert in any specific language to perform the
audit.

[[validate-initial-code]]
==== Validate Initial Code

Read the commit messages and ensure that you can replicate their initial
state. Validate the initial source archive by ensuring that:

* It comes from a reputable source
* It matches the hash provided

Using git, ensure that the initial files match the ones in the archive:

* Branch your git repository at the commit that first included the files
* Add the files you extracted from the archive
* Use git to see the changes between the files

Investigate any differences. Communicate with the QuickStart author;
it's possible that they accidentally modified files before committing
them.

[[analyze-any-code-changes]]
==== Analyze any code changes

This may be a long process, but it is vital to staying secure. If we can
get master branches and commits validated, it may expedite any branches
that fork from there

Ensure that there is nothing 'odd' being added to the repository.
Related changes should be grouped into single commits, and any additions
should only affect:

* OpenShift specific configuration
** Replacing database configuration variables
** Adding OpenShift security functions
* Specific configuration changes/enhancements (like adding caching or
pre-compiling assets to serve)
* Fixes for specific vulnerabilities/security issues (comments on these
should clearly indicate what issue they are resolving)

[[fork-the-repository-into-an-official-openshift-quickstart]]
==== Fork the Repository into an Official OpenShift QuickStart

Once you are satisfied that the QuickStart is well-secured, you can fork
the author's repository. This will enable us to create an app template
based on the QuickStart.
