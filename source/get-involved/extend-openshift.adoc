= Extend OpenShift
[.lead]
Bring your favorite technologies to OpenShift as a QuickStart or make
your code reusable in a Cartridge. Or get the source and extend the
platform.

== Adding QuickStarts
A QuickStart is just a Git source repository paired with one or more
cartridges that makes it easy for someone to start from your foundation.
You won't get automatic updates, but they're a great way to help someone
understand a framework or try out an integration.

To get started, read the
link:#create-a-quickstart[QuickStart
Developer's Guide], which outlines the process for creating a new
QuickStart as well as keeping it up-to-date and secure.

== Build a Cartridge
It's easy to add your own frameworks and backends to OpenShift. Through
our open Cartridge API you can add your own binaries and logic to
OpenShift - anything that can run in Linux can run in your app.

To start, follow this guided tour of building cartridges, using a simple
Apache web server as an example.

and a simple web server]

the example as a cartridge]

Then read the
link:http://docs.openshift.org/origin-m4/oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html[Cartridge
Developer's Guide], which breaks down the Cartridge API and is the
primary reference for building a cartridge.

To make it easy to try your cartridge, learn how to

downloadable] so you can install it to OpenShift Online.

[[get-involved-upstream]]
== Get Involved Upstream
The OpenShift platform is a pluggable Rails application that allows
direct extension. If you're looking to integrate OpenShift with your own
backend systems for authentication, add new security layers, expose
custom platform logic, or go a step beyond a cartridge, you'll want to
check out the http://openshift.github.io[Origin source and community].
