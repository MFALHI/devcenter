[.lead]
JBoss xPaaS services provide the powerful capabilities of JBoss Middleware as cloud based services on OpenShift. Developers can build applications, integrate with other systems, orchestrate using rules and processes, and then deploy across hybrid environments.

== Application Container Services
Complex enterprise applications need to run on one of the four "footprints" - physical, virtual, private, or public - leveraging core services like persistence and transactions from the container.

=== Enterprise Application Platform
The *JBoss EAP Cartridge* provides the JBoss EAP application server on OpenShift. This cartridge provides a supported Java EE Application Server.
OpenShift Online currently supports `JBoss EAP 6.4`, which supports Java 8.

Organizations are under huge pressure to deliver business value and innovations to market fast - faster than the competition.  As they struggle to keep up, organizations are turning to DevOps methodologies and PaaS technologies to accelerate application development and delivery while still maintaining high levels of quality and reliability.

OpenShift by Red Hat gives developers flexibility to use the platforms and tools they choose while freeing them from provisioning, maintaining, and securing application infrastructure. With commercial support for Tomcat as well as JBoss EAP for xPaaS, organizations looking to deploy or move their applications into the cloud don't need to start over from scratch or compromise with a limited web profile that cannot meet key enterprise performance requirements. Lightweight and enterprise-class, JBoss EAP for xPaaS is the only mainstream Java EE 6 application platform available in private and public clouds.  Offering organizations the best of both Dev and Ops, JBoss EAP for xPaaS provides the ability to quickly build enterprise grade Java applications in a streamlined PaaS environment.

== Integration Services
Modern applications are designed to connect with other applications and data to enhance their functionality without having duplication. Better to connect and consume than to replicate; Integration Services allow developers to connect to applications and data, send and receive messages - all with the reliability and precision of enterprise grade technology.

=== Data Virtualization
JBoss Data Virtualization is a technology which allows applications to use data from multiple heterogeneous data sources. It comprises tools and runtime services for creating and executing bi-directional data services.

== Mobile Services
With mobile devices becoming a primary client in the enterprise, incorporating key mobile features and capabilities are a vital part of any application development project. Mobile services simplify and streamline supporting the many mobile client types while extending your application to these devices.

=== Unified Push
The JBoss Unified Push server allows developers to send native push messages to Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS) and Google's Cloud Messaging (GCM). It features a built-in administration console that makes it easy for developers to create and manage the push related aspects of their applications for any mobile development environment.  Includes client SDKs (iOS, Android, & Cordova), and a REST based sender service with an available Java sender library.
