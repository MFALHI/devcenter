Installing the JBoss Developer Studio executable *.jar* file requires you already have Java installed for your platform. What follows is a step by step guide for walking through the JBoss Developer Studio installation wizard.

NOTE: In order to verify that the currently installed Java supports the JBoss Developer Studio version you are about to install, please visit the link:http://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio/overview/[JBoss website], where you can find a link to documentation describing what Java version is required. For example, the JBoss Developer Studio 9.1.0 can be installed using an older version of Java, but it requires Java 8 to run.
