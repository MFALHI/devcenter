It's easy to get up and running on OpenShift, but you have a lot of choice when it comes to your preferred environment. Below you'll find the information you need to get started creating and managing applications on OpenShift.

OpenShift allows a choice of environments (UI, command line, IDE), but in order to get the most out of your applications, you'll want to at least use the OpenShift client tools (*rhc*). RHC is a ruby gem, and requires *Ruby* and *Git*.

If you just want to log in and create your first application, you can simply log into the link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/login?then=%2Fapp%2Fconsole[web console (requires login)]. However, you won't be able to make changes to your application until you've followed the instructions below.
