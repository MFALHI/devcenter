= Using OpenShift in Eclipse
[.lead]
You can create and manage OpenShift applications in the Eclipse IDE thanks to JBoss Tools. The following step-by-step guide shows you how to install, configure, and use this integration to create an OpenShift application.

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Install Eclipse
Point your browser at the link:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse download page] and select the installation package for your needs.  This guide uses the *Eclipse IDE for Java Developers* package.

After downloading Eclipse, extract the archive and you will have an _eclipse_ directory.  Inside of this directory, you will have an Eclipse executable that will start the IDE.

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Install OpenShift JBoss Tools Package
Once you have Eclipse up and running, the next step is to install the JBoss Tools package that provides the OpenShift integration.  You can install JBoss Tools from the link:http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jboss-tools-luna[Eclipse marketplace] by dragging *Install* (See below) to an open Eclipse window. Make sure that the version of JBoss Tools that you are using matches the version of Eclipse that you are using (Luna, Kepler, etc.).

image::eclipse/step2.png[Step 2a: Install OpenShift JBoss Tools Package]

Expand *JBoss Tools* and select *JBoss OpenShift Tools*:

Once the JBoss OpenShift tools have been installed, you will need to restart Eclipse:

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Create an OpenShift Project
Now that you have the toolset installed, it's time to create a cloud project and begin development.  Select *File* > *New* > *Other* > *OpenShift* > *OpenShift Application* and click *Next*:

image::eclipse/step3.png[Step 3: Create an OpenShift Project]

Before you can start creating and deploying your projects, you will need to authenticate with the OpenShift web services via the dialog provided:

image::eclipse/step3b.png[Step 3b: Create an OpenShift Project]

If you do not already have an OpenShift account, click the sign up link or link:https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new[go here] and create a new account.

After creating your account, you will need to specify a domain that you want to use for your applications.  The domain is used to create the unique URL for your running application with the following template: _applicationName-domainName.rhcloud.com_. The domain you select will be used for all of your deployed applications on OpenShift Online.

Once you have successfully authenticated to the OpenShift web services, you will be presented with the *Setup OpenShift Application Wizard*.  The dialog provides the following functionality:

* Use an existing application that is already deployed on your OpenShift account
* View details for existing application
* Create new application
* Add cartridges to your application
* Specify your gear size
* Enable scaling for your application

image::eclipse/step3c.png[Step 3c: Create an OpenShift Project]

NOTE: Although in this guide, you are creating a new application, if you want to continue development on an existing application, select *Use my existing OpenShift application* and click *Browse...*.  This will create a new Eclipse project and perform a git clone on your existing git repository.

In order to create a new application, give your application a name and select which link:/languages/index.html[cartridge or application server] that your deployment will target.

[[step4]]
== Step 4: Configure SSH Keys
In order to communicate via git to your repository, you'll need to configure your link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell[SSH] keys. If you are a new OpenShift user, you can link:/getting-started/index.html[install the client tools] and run `rhc setup` - SSH keys are created and uploaded as part of this process. See link:/managing-your-applications/remote-connection.html#setting-up-ssh-keys[Remote Connection (SSH)] for more information.

If you are an existing OpenShift user, you will need to use your existing key or create a new one.  Fortunately, we provide a UI to accomplish this task as well. Click the *SSH2 Preferences* link provided in order to create your keys:

image::eclipse/step4.png[Step 4: Configure SSH Keys]

If you don't already have a ssh key created on your machine, select the *Key Management* tab > *Generate RSA Key*.  Provide a passphrase if you desire and then click *Save Private Key*.  You will also want to copy your public key that is displayed so that we can add it to OpenShift.

image::eclipse/step4b.png[Step 4b: Configure SSH Keys]

Now that you have a key pair generated, we need to tell OpenShift what our public key is.  Log in to your OpenShift account, click *Settings*, and select to *Add a new key...*.

image::eclipse/step4c.png[Step 4b: Configure SSH Keys]

Give your new key a name of JBossTools and paste the key into the textfield provided.

[[step5]]
== Step 5: Clone your Repo
After creating and publishing your public SSH key to OpenShift, you are ready to clone your repo and begin development.  Switch back over to your Eclipse IDE and click the *Finish* button.  This will create your project and clone the private git repository that lives on the OpenShift servers.

[[step6]]
== Step 6: Code
This is what you love to do.

[[step7]]
== Step 7: Update Maven Configuration
You may notice an error marker next your project after you have cloned your git repository.  This is easily fixed by updating your maven project configuration.  Right click on your project, select maven, and then update project configuration.

[[step8]]
== Step 8: Deploy your Code
Once you have modified some of your source files, click the server tab at the bottom of the screen.  You should see your OpenShift application listed.  In order to push your changes live, right click on your application and select publish.

image::eclipse/step8.png[Step 8: Deploy your Code]

Once the push process is complete, point your browser to applicatonName-namespace.rhcloud.com and you should see your brand new application deployed on the cloud.

== Other Options

=== Viewing Log Files
An important step in developing software is the ability to view your server log files.  In order to view the server log files, select the server tab, right click on your application, select *OpenShift* and then *Tail Files...*

image::eclipse/log-files.jpg[Eclipse Log Files]

This will open up the console view tab and allow you to monitor your logs files on the system.

=== Port Forwarding
When developing database driven applications, it is essential that you have access to connect to your database in both your development and production environments.  Doing this without opening yourself up to security concerns is often a place where developers that are not intimately familiar with system administration and firewall configuration may stumble.

With OpenShift port forwarding, developers are now able to connect to their remote services while using local client tools without having to worry about the details of configuring complicated firewall rules.

In order to use port forwarding from inside of Eclipse, select the server tab, right click on your application, select *OpenShift* and then *Port Forwarding...*
