[[step1]]
== Step 1: Create a Zend Server Application
This tutorial walks through the creation of an application titled *myphpapp* under the domain *mydomain*. Before going through the rest of the tutorial, be sure to have link:https://www.openshift.com/app/account[created an OpenShift account] and link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[installed the RHC command line tools].

Once that is completed, open a terminal on a local machine and change into the directory where you would like the OpenShift application source code to be located. At the command prompt, enter the following command to create a Zend Server application:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc app create myphpapp zend-6.1
----

The output will look something like this:

[source, console]
----
Application Options
-------------------
Domain:     mydomain
Cartridges: zend-6.1
Gear Size:  default
Scaling:    no

Creating application 'myphpapp' ... done

  Note: You should set password for the Zend Server Console at: https://pz-mjelen.rhcloud.com/ZendServer
Zend Server 6 started successfully

Waiting for your DNS name to be available ... done

Cloning into 'myphpapp'...
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '54.224.97.114' to the list of known hosts.

Your application 'myphpapp' is now available.

  URL:        http://myphpapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com/ <1>
  SSH to:     5330abc150044678dc000029@myphpapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com
  Git remote: ssh://5330abc150044678dc000029@myphpapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com/~/git/myphpapp.git/
  Cloned to:  /home/me/git_demo/myphpapp <2>

Run 'rhc show-app myphpapp' for more details about your app.
----
<1> Public URL of application
<2> Location of local Git repository

The application will now be running and accessible at the *URL (1)* listed in the output. A local Git repository for your application was also created in the directory listed under *Cloned to (2)*.

== Step 2: Make the First Change
A developer on OpenShift can make code changes on a local machine, check those changes in locally, and then `git push` those changes to OpenShift. One of the primary advantages of the Git version control system is that it does not require a continuous online presence in order to run. A developer can easily check in (`commit`, in Git terminology) and revert changes locally before deciding to upload those changes to OpenShift.

=== Using the Git Repository
To make the first change, edit `index.php` in the `myphpapp` directory. Go to the file in the terminal and edit with a command line editor such as *Vim* or *Emacs*. Alternatively, edit the file using any text editor or IDE. Strip out everything between the two `<body>` tags and change the content to look like this:

[source, html]
----
<body>
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
----

Now that you have made this code change, the new code must be deployed to the server. You can accomplish this task using *Git*.

. To add the change to the Git repository's index and stage it for the next commit, use the command `git add`:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git add --all .
----
+
. Next `commit` the staged changes to the Git repository, with a log message to explain the changes:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
----
+
. Finally, `push` these changes to the remote OpenShift application.
+
[source, console]
----
$ git push
----

The output of the `push` command will first show the `git push`, and then the build process and deployment of the code on OpenShift. When the build is finished, go back to the application's URL (_myphpapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com_) and you should see a page that simply says "Hello World".

This is the basic process to follow when developing an application: `git add`, `git commit`, and finally `git push`.

If you are curious about Git or would like to learn more, the link:http://git-scm.com/book[Pro Git book] is a great resource.

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Managing Dependencies
Your Zend Server application code may rely on third-party libraries that you wish to include in your build. To add dependencies using the PHP Extension and Application Repository (PEAR), add the names of the libraries in *.openshift/pear.txt*. For example, the contents of your *pear.txt* file could be the following:

[source, console]
----
net_url
auth_sasl
----

Use Git to add, commit, and push your changes to *pear.txt* to OpenShift.

To use an alternative dependency manager, such as Composer, add any commands you would like to be executed at build time on OpenShift into an link:/managing-your-applications/action-hooks.html[action hook script] at *.openshift/action_hooks/build*.

== Hot Deploy and Other Markers
By default, when a `git push` occurs as outlined above, OpenShift starts and stops the Apache server to deploy the new build. However, it is possible to deploy code without restarting the server. See link:/managing-your-applications/modifying-applications.html#hot-deployment[Hot Deployment] for more information on how a marker file in the Git repository can be used to turn on this build style.

More Zend Server marker files are listed in the link:/languages/php/markers.html[Markers section].

== Adding a Database to an Application
Find out how to add a database to your application by going to the link:/managing-your-applications/adding-a-database.html[Adding a Database] guide.

IMPORTANT: You should only use link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[environment variables] to specify the connection parameters for your database. Using hard coded names, ports, or credentials limits the resusability of your app and can potentially break your app during OpenShift maintenance.
