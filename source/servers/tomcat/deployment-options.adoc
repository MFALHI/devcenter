= Tomcat Deployment Options
There are two options for deploying content to the Tomcat Server within OpenShift. Both options
can be used together (i.e. build one archive from source and others pre-built)

== Git Push Source Files
You can upload your content in a Maven src structure as in this sample project and on
`git push` have the application built and deployed.

For this to work you'll need your `pom.xml` at the
root of your repository and a `maven-war-plugin` as in this example to move the output from the build to the `webapps` directory.

By default the `warName` is `ROOT` within `pom.xml`.  This will cause the `webapp` contents to be rendered at `\http://app_name-namespace.rhcloud.com/`.  If you change the `warName` in
`pom.xml` to *app_name*, your base url would then become `\http://app_name-namespace.rhcloud.com/app_name`.

NOTE: If you are building locally you'll also want to add any output WARs under `webapps` from the build to your `.gitignore` file.

NOTE: If you are running scaled EWS then you need an application deployed to the root context (i.e. `\http://app_name-namespace.rhcloud.com/`) for the HAProxy load-balancer to recognize that the EWS instance is active.

Whether you choose option 1) or 2) the end result will be the application
deployed into the `webapps` directory. The `webapps` directory in the
Tomcat distribution is the location end users can place
their deployment content (e.g. WAR, EAR, JAR, SAR files) to have it
automatically deployed into the server runtime.
