=== Example Use

Getting a PHP app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp php-5.4
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure PHP, MySQL, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

[[phpmyadmin]]
=== phpMyAdmin
The link:addons-phpmyadmin.html[*phpmyadmin* cartridge] provides http://www.phpmyadmin.net[phpMyAdmin] on OpenShift. In order to add this cartridge to an application, the link:#top[MySQL] cartridge must already be present. Once installed, phpMyAdmin can be used by navigating to http://_app_-_domain_.rhcloud.com/phpmyadmin with the MySQL login credentials.
