= Ceylon Application Hosting

With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Ceylon applications using your favorite application servers or frameworks. You can run them bare-bones with the Ceylon cartridge (and any framework of your choice) or with the Vert.x cartridge.

Ceylon is a new programming language that's deeply influenced by Java, designed by people who are unapologetic fans of Java. It's a language designed specifically for writing large programs in teams.

Visit the official Ceylon documentation to link:http://ceylon-lang.org[learn more].

== Supported Technologies
OpenShift provides several ways to deploy Ceylon applications, including the following environments:


=== Using the Ceylon cartridge

Getting your Ceylon application deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing the following command:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app ceylonapp https://raw.github.com/ceylon/openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--

This will create your OpenShift application using the Ceylon cartridge, which will include a template application
running barebones, which you can replace or customise.

For important information on setting up your Ceylon cartridge, check out our link:https://github.com/ceylon/openshift-cartridge/blob/master/template/README.md[documentation] page.

=== Even simpler application creation with the Ceylon cartridge and `ceylon.openshift` module

It's trivial to make your application run on OpenShift. Just take your existing application and add the following
import:

[source, ceylon]
--
import ceylon.openshift "1.1.1";
--

This will let you access OpenShift information:

[source, ceylon]
--
import ceylon.openshift { openshift }

void start(String host, int port){
  // ...
}

shared void run(){
  if(openshift.running){
    start(openshift.ceylon.ip, openshift.ceylon.port);
  }else{
    start("localhost", 80);
  }
}
--

Similarly you can get information about your database. Read the link:https://modules.ceylon-lang.org/repo/1/ceylon/openshift/1.1.1/module-doc/api/openshift.object.html[API docs for more information].

Now you just have to add the required OpenShift setup to your application, for which
you can install the `ceylon openshift` command (only need to do this once):

[source]
--
$ ceylon plugin install ceylon.openshift/1.1.1
--

And now you just turn your Ceylon application into a Ceylon OpenShift application:

[source]
--
$ ceylon openshift init your.main.module/1.0
--

Then you're ready to start, so just push your code somewhere over git and create your
OpenShift application with the Ceylon cartridge:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app --from-code <your-git-url> ceylonapp https://raw.github.com/ceylon/openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--

=== Using the link:/servers/vertx.html[Vert.x] cartridge

link:http://vertx.io/[Vert.x] is a lightweight, high performance polyglot application platform for the JVM that's designed for modern mobile, web, and enterprise applications. OpenShift Online currently supports `Vert.x 2.1`. +  link:/servers/vertx.html[-> Learn More]

You can also use the Vert.x cartridge and write your verticles in Ceylon, as described link:http://vertx.io/core_manual_ceylon.html[in the Vert.x manual].

You can deploy your Ceylon verticles as described in the  link:/servers/vertx.html[Vert.x cartridge manual],
with the following addentums:

You will need to specify an alternate cache folder for Ceylon to use with this option in `configuration/vertx.env`:

[source]
--
export VERTX_OPTS="-Dceylon.cache.repo=${OPENSHIFT_VERTX_DIR}/cache"
--

If you deploy your Ceylon verticles already compiled, it's best to publish them in the default `modules` folder
and point Vert.x to it with this setup in `configuration/vertx.env` (as well as the cache setup above):

[source]
--
export vertx_app="ceylon:your.module.name/yourModuleVersion"
--

Then you can use `ceylon.openshift` to get the Vert.x IP and port to bind to:

[source, ceylon]
--
import ceylon.openshift { openshift }

void start(String host, int port){
  // ...
}

shared void run(){
  if(openshift.running){
    start(openshift.vertx.ip, openshift.vertx.port);
  }else{
    start("localhost", 80);
  }
}
