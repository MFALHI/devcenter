[float]
= Python Environment Variables

The `python` cartridge supports the following environment variables:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name |Purpose

|OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION
|Set custom path to the WSGI entry-point, eg. using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION=app/altenative-wsgi.py`
command.

|OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH
|Set custom path to the pip requirements file, eg. using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH=requirements/production.txt`
command.
|===

For some frameworks (such as Django) it is possible to set the `DEBUG` user
environment variable using the `rhc env set DEBUG=True` command.
In that case, Django will run in 'debug' mode, with more verbose logging and
nice error reporting of HTTP 500 errors.

See the other link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[Environment Variables] that are available on OpenShift.
