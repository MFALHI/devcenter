    WSGI entry-point with higher priority. You can customize the path using the
    `OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION` envirotnment variable. See link:/languages/python/environment-variables.html[the environment
    variables] page for more information.
<2> Adding dependencies to the `install_requires` section of `setup.py` file will
    cause the cartridge to install those dependencies at git push time.
<3> Adding dependencies to this file will cause the cartridge to run
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` command at git push time. You can customize
    the path using the `OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH` variable. See link:/languages/python/environment-variables.html[the environment
    variables] page for more information.
