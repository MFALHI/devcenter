With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Python applications using your favorite frameworks and databases. Want a Tornado server running Django and backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for Flask and MongoDB? OpenShift Online currently supports `Python 2.6`, `2.7`, and `3.3`.

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability. The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) defines a simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the Python programming language. link:https://www.python.org/[-> Learn more]
