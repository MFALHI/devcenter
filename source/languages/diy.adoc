The `diy` cartridge provides a minimal, free-form scaffolding which leaves all details of the cartridge to the application developer.

== Get started
. Add the framework of choice to your repo.
. Modify `.openshift/action_hooks/start` to start your application. The application is required to bind to `$OPENSHIFT_DIY_IP:$OPENSHIFT_DIY_PORT`.
. Modify `.openshift/action_hooks/stop` to stop your application.
. Commit and push your changes.
