= Environment Variables
The `php` cartridges provide several additional environment variables to reference for ease of use:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name|Description
|OPENSHIFT_PHP_IP|The IP address the application listens on.
|OPENSHIFT_PHP_PORT|The port the application receives requests from.
|===

The `php` cartridges also provides several environment variables to change the default PHP configuration:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Variable name |Description

|APPLICATION_ENV
|Application mode, default setting is `production`. When set to `development`, the Xdebug extension is enabled, more verbose `error_reporting` and the `APC.stat` setting are set. See link:/languages/php/getting-started.html#development-mode[development mode] for more details.

|OPENSHIFT_PHP_APC_ENABLED
|Whether APC op-code cache PECL is enabled, `true` by default. Set value to `false` to turn this extension off.

|OPENSHIFT_PHP_APC_SHM_SIZE
|The APC shared memory size. The default value is `64M` on Small and Small.highcpu gears, `128M` on Medium gears, and `256M` on Large gears.

|OPENSHIFT_PHP_XDEBUG_ENABLED
|Whether Xdebug PECL is enabled, `true` by default. Set value to `false` to turn this extension off. This variable overrides behavior set by `APPLICATION_ENV`.

|OPENSHIFT_PHP_<MODULE>_ENABLED
|Whether `<MODULE>` PECL is enabled, `true` by default. Set value to `false` to turn the specified extension off. To list all enabled modules, run `php -m` command while ssh'd into the gear.

|LOGSHIFTER_PHP_MAX_FILESIZE
|A case-insensitive string representing the maximum log file size that triggers a roll event. The default value is *10M*. If a zero size is specified regardless of the unit, log rolling is effectively disabled.

|LOGSHIFTER_PHP_MAX_FILES
|An integer representing the maximum number of log files to retain. The default is *10*. See link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html#logging-variables[logging environment variables] for more details.
|===

NOTE: You must restart the `php` cartridge to pick-up the updated values.

NOTE: The above 'defaults' are the default setting, not the default value for the variables. If no user-created environment variable is set, the default setting will be used.

== Reading Environment Variables
The following example demonstrates how to read environment variables within your application code:

[source, php]
----
$env_var = getenv('OPENSHIFT_ENV_VAR');
----

Developers can safely store API keys and other credentials in the system environment by using `rhc env set`, allowing for clean and portable application sources. Learn more about link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[using environment variables].
