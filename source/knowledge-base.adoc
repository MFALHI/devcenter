[[sync-a-new-git-repo-with-an-existing-git-repo]]
=== Sync a new git repo with an existing git repo
Before attempting to merge the two repositories, you need the remote git URL. This is displayed at creation time with the `rhc app create -a <app_name>` command. You can also get it via the `rhc app show -a <app_name>` command for existing application. This example uses:
[source,console]
--
ssh://284bdd9fd9764803939ac5c309634ee6@myapp-mcgrath.rhcloud.com/~/git/myapp.git/
--

Next, you'll be pulling the remote repo into your local upstream repo. This will cause conflicts. First run the following command substituting your applications remote git repo:
[source,console]
--
$ git pull ssh://284bdd9fd9764803939ac5c309634ee6@myapp-mcgrath.rhcloud.com/~/git/myapp.git/
--
This will let you know about conflicts. You might see, for example:
[source,console]
--
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in php/index.php
--
Fix whatever conflicts are found and `git commit` them. Remember, OpenShift is looking for some things in specific directories.
[source,console]
--
$ git commit -a -m "fixing OpenShift merge"
--
Once the merge is complete you can `git push` the master branch up to OpenShift (note the addition of `master` at the end to specify branch):
[source,console]
--
$ git push ssh://284bdd9fd9764803939ac5c309634ee6@myapp-mcgrath.rhcloud.com/~/git/myapp.git/ master
--
Next, `git push` to your upstream repo as normal and both git repos should now be in sync. Take a look at git's documentation to alter your .git/config directory to make it easier to push to each remote repo.

[[does-openshift-online-support-outgoing-email]]
=== Does OpenShift Online support outgoing email?
OpenShift Online supports limited outgoing email by default, but has a very strong spam filter. You should consider using a third party email service such as link:https://sendgrid.com/[Sendgrid] or MailGun.

You can also use your own authenticated email service such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook, or your own private email server.

[[how-do-i-see-how-many-apps-i-have-deployed]]
=== How do I see how many apps I have deployed?
The link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/applications[web console] will list the numbers of applications you have deployed.

You can also use the following rhc command:
[source,console]
--
$ rhc apps
--

[[how-do-i-look-up-my-namespace]]
=== How do I look up my namespace?
Log into the link:http://openshift.redhat.com[web console] and click *My Account*. This will display your namespace and give you the opportunity to change it.

You can also use the following rhc command:
[source,console]
--
$ rhc domains
--

To rename your namespace:
[source,console]
--
$ rhc domain-rename <old_name> <new_name>
--

NOTE: You can only rename an empty domain at this time. You will need to delete your applications and recreate them if you need to change your namespace.

[[can-i-have-mulitple-namespaces]]
=== Can I have multiple namespaces?

[[evaluating-the-traffic-to-your-openshift-application]]
=== Evaluating the traffic to your OpenShift application
One way to do this is by using link:https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/3-piwik[Piwik] or link:http://www.google.com/analytics/[Google Analytics].

You can also use:
[source, console]
--
$ rhc app snapshot save -a <app_name>
--

to get the logfiles from your running app, which you can run through a logfile analyzer like link:http://awstats.sourceforge.net/[AWStats].
